#Practice 1 

#Create a Python dictionary called student_grades with the following student names as keys and their grades as values: Alice (85), Bob (90), and Chandra (78). Then, update Bob’s grade to 95. What does the dictionary look like after this update?

student_grades = {'Alice':85, 'Bob':90, 'Chandra':78}
student_grades['Bob'] = 95
student_grades['Sierra'] = 70
print(student_grades)

#If the key already exists, dict[key] = value updates it
# If the key does not exist, dict[key] = value creates it

#Practice 2

#for the dict below use appropriate dictionary methods to:
#1. List all the cities (keys) in the dictionary.
#2. List all the populations (values).
#3. Check if the city "Miami" exists in the dictionary

city_population = {
    "Denver": 727211,
    "Seattle": 744955,
    "Austin": 964254
}

print(city_population.keys()) #instead of the long way of creating a new collection of keys then printing it we can just use the function in the print command
print(city_population.values())
print('Miami' in city_population)

#Practice 3 

#Write a Python script that takes the string "banana" and uses a dictionary to count how many times each character appears in the string. What is the resulting dictionary?

my_string = 'banana'
count_dict = {}

for char in my_string:
    if char not in count_dict: #we say in count dict not my string cause every char we loop over is always in my_string; this lets us check if this is the first time we’ve seen that character.
        count_dict[char] = 1 #count_dict starts empty {} and grows as we count
    else:
        count_dict[char] = count_dict[char] + 1
print(count_dict)
