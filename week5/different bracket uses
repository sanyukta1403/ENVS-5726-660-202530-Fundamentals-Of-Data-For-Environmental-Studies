Uses of the different brackets:

Parentheses ()
    1. Function calls: ex print(), len()
    2. Defining functions: def xyz()
    3. Tuples: t=(1,2,3) 
        tuples are different from lists in that they cannot be changed once created; you use them when you want data to stay fixed or represent a single "record" ex: storing coordinates (x, y), or database rows
    4. Grouping expressions: result = (2 + 3) * 4 

Square brackets []
    1. Lists ex: [10,20,30]
    2. Indexing and slicing ex: my_list[0] will give 10 and my_list[1:3] will give [20,30]
    3. List comprehensions 

Curly braces {}
    1. Dictionaries 
    2. Sets 
    3. Dictionary comprehensions
